                <h1>Turkish Kebab</h1>
                <p>Youll find kebabs in countries all over the world, so what does kebab even mean? Essentially its a
                    way of
                    lumping a number of varieties of meat dishes together. Most often theyre cooked either on a skewer
                    or a
                    spit. There is some evidence that the word itself derives from ancient Turkic languages (themselves
                    partially derived from Arabic), and it meant originally "roasted meat."</p>
